Storyline: You have been sentenced to death for stealing food from another member on board your spaceship. However, the spaceship plans on landing on 10 different planets for supplies this month, so they are giving you the opportunity to be exonerated if you are able to clear all 10 of these zones of their undead populations. In hopes of getting the most utility out of your efforts as possible, they plan to drop you off at the planets in order of their clearing difficulties. In order to avoid being spotted by enemy ships, the council has decided to give you no more than 60 seconds to clear each zone before they abandon you. Win your freedom by defeating all enemies within 60 seconds on 10 different planets, each planet being more difficult to clear than the last, or die trying.
